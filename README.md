# Real-time Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

This project implements a high-performance, industrial-grade end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline designed for real-time social media monitoring. It leverages a modern Big Data stack and follows advanced Data Engineering principles, including modular architecture, strict data validation, and vectorized processing.

## Business Value and Use Cases

In a digital-first world, understanding public sentiment in real-time provides a significant competitive advantage. This pipeline is designed to solve several critical business challenges:

1. **Brand Reputation Management**: Instantly detect shifts in public sentiment towards a brand or product, allowing for immediate crisis intervention.
2. **Customer Experience Optimization**: Identify dissatisfied customers in real-time to prioritize support tickets and improve Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores.
3. **Market Trend Analysis**: Monitor the reception of new product launches or marketing campaigns as they happen across different regions and platforms.
4. **Automated Moderation**: Flag high-intensity negative emotions (e.g., anger, bitterness) for human review or automated filtering.

## Technical Architecture

The system is built with a decoupled, modular architecture to ensure maximum scalability and fault tolerance.

### 1. Ingestion Layer (src/ingestion)
The entry point of the system is a Kafka Producer that simulates high-frequency data streams. 
- **Data Governance**: Utilizes Pydantic for runtime schema validation. Any record failing validation (e.g., missing text, invalid timestamp) is logged and skipped, preventing "poison pills" from entering the pipeline.
- **Resilience**: Implements robust error handling to ensure continuous streaming even when encountering malformed source data.

### 2. Stream Processing Layer (src/processing)
The core logic resides in an Apache Spark Streaming application.
- **Optimization (Vectorized Inference)**: Traditional Spark UDFs suffer from significant overhead due to row-by-row serialization between the JVM and Python. This project utilizes **Pandas UDFs (Vectorized UDFs)** which use **Apache Arrow** for zero-copy data transfer. This allows the model to process data in batches (vectors), utilizing NumPy-level speeds.
- **State Management**: Implements Spark Checkpointing to ensure the pipeline can recover its state and offset position in the event of a system failure.

### 3. Storage and Serving Layer (src/api)
- **Database**: MongoDB serves as the sink for the analytical results, providing a flexible schema for unstructured social media data and supporting rapid aggregation queries.
- **API**: A FastAPI-based REST service exposes the processed data. It provides endpoints for retrieving live insights, historical statistics, and individual model predictions.

### 4. Visualization Layer (src/dashboard)
- **Live Monitoring**: A Streamlit dashboard provides a real-time view of the data flowing through the system.
- **Insights**: Visualizes sentiment distribution, geographical activity trends, and platform-specific engagement metrics.

### 5. MLOps and Lineage (src/ml)
- **Experiment Tracking**: Integrated with MLflow to log training parameters, metrics, and serialized model artifacts.
- **Model Pipeline**: Uses a scikit-learn pipeline (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) trained on a rich dataset featuring over 30 emotional categories.

## Performance Benchmarking

The primary technical achievement of this project is the optimization of the inference engine. By migrating from Scalar UDFs to Vectorized Pandas UDFs, the system achieves near-production throughput on commodity hardware.

### Benchmark Results (5,000 Records)
- **Scalar UDF (Row-by-Row)**: ~70.13 seconds (~71 records/sec)
- **Pandas UDF (Vectorized)**: ~0.15 seconds (~33,300 records/sec)
- **Performance Gain**: 478x faster

This optimization allows the system to scale to millions of messages per day without requiring a massive hardware footprint.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 17+

### 1. Environment Setup
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Infrastructure Deployment
Launch the core services (Kafka, Zookeeper, MongoDB, Spark):
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Model Training
Train the initial model and register it with MLflow:
```bash
make train
```

## Running the Pipeline

To run the full end-to-end pipeline, execute these commands in separate terminal sessions:

1. **Ingestion**: Start streaming data from the source to Kafka.
   ```bash
   make producer
   ```
2. **Processing**: Start the Spark Streaming engine.
   ```bash
   make processor
   ```
3. **Dashboard**: Launch the real-time monitoring tool.
   ```bash
   make dashboard
   ```
4. **API**: Start the backend service for external access.
   ```bash
   make api
   ```

## API Documentation

The following REST endpoints are available (default port 8000):
- GET /: Service status and health check.
- GET /latest?limit=N: Retrieve the N most recent sentiment records.
- GET /stats: Retrieve aggregated sentiment counts across the entire dataset.
- POST /predict?text=...: Perform real-time inference on a single custom string.

## Production Considerations

- **Scalability**: The modular design allows Kafka brokers and Spark workers to be scaled horizontally.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Spark Checkpointing and Kafka's distributed nature ensure no data loss during infrastructure outages.
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging is implemented across all modules to facilitate debugging and observability in production environments.
